# M20-Credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

**Analysis**
The purpose of this analysis is to know if the model is trustable for identifying high-risk loans and healthy loans based on their precision percent and also on the balanced accuracy score. 

Accuracy, Precision and Scores:
The accuracy, precision and all other scores where the exact same with and without the model. The precision for healthy loans was 100% and for at high-risk loans was an 85%. The balanced accuracy score was 0.95


I would recommend the model for predicting healthy loans, but not so good for predicting hight-risk loans.
